## Notes on Introduction to Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm.

Logistic Regression can be broken into a simple function

                  g(x) = Wo + W(xi)
                  sigmoid(g(x))

As Linear Regression, it is also a linear model which basically takes the `Sigmoid` of the output of the Linear Regression Score.

Both work well when the relationship between data variables are linear.

One key thing to note while building models is knowing how much your data are related with one another and also knowing how much they(each feature) affect the target variable. With these, you can know what features are worth it or not. This step could even improve your model :)
